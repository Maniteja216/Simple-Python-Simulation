What are simulations?
A simulation is simply an imitation of a situation or a process. In the case of this pandemic, governments use simulations to see how different factors, like the ones listed above, impact the spread of COVID-19.
Simulations are useful for a number of reasons:
They can turn into powerful visualizations that make it easier to communicate insights and findings.
They can be used for predictions and forecasting, but we’ll talk more about this later.
They can help you understand the most important factors in a simulation. (Eg. How does a 1% change in factor A affect the output vs a 1% change in factor B?)
A big misconception about simulations is that they’re really complicated, and that’s not necessarily the case! Simulations can end up being very complex, but they can also be very simple.
In this article, you’ll learn how to build a very simple simulation/model of population growth, as well as how it can be improved.

# Simple-Python-Simulation
The most basic human population simulator that we could possibly create would be something like this, where the initial population is 50 and we want to see how the population grows to 1,000,000
